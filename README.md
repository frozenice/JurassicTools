JurassicTools provides additions to the [Jurassic JS engine](http://jurassic.codeplex.com/).

Some features include:
* Works cross-platform (tested with .NET 4.0 and Mono 2.10)
* Easily expose classes without the need to inherit from FunctionInstance or similar
* That means you can use your code either from JS or from .NET
* Support for enums, varargs and automatic conversion of compatible types
* Transparent objects
* Delegates
* Expose 3rd party classes (even .NET framework stuff)
* Tight control over what gets exposed and what not
